# Backrooms-found-footage-Data-Protection-Policy

Welcome to the Backrooms found footage app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Yunus Özkul. The app is available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have programmed this app to collect personally identifiable information. We collect your data for personalized ads. Other data created from you (for example game settings) created by you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Yunus Özkul
